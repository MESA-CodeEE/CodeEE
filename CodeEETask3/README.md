## First Challenge

### Task 3

#### **Instructions:**

`array1 = [1, 4, 11, 3, 6,1000,1999,100,200,300,305,1254,5464897,8979,897,895,64141,1321,31,645]`

`array2= [2,3,11,7,9,555,512,55669,25541,521548,45487,656897,45478,445487,457845,487845487,5646]`

Based on the two arrays given, participants are required to find the intersecting values and find the difference `difference` between them. Refer `difference` to the alphabet reference above to obtain the third alphabet.

Reference to 'Alphabet reference table' for the hint.
